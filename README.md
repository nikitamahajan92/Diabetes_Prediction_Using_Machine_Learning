# Diabetes_Pridiction_Using_Machine_Learning

The increasing prevalence of diabetes has underscored the need for innovative methods of early prediction and diagnosis. Utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms for healthcare diagnostics offers the potential for more precise and effective disease management. This project undertakes a detailed examination of the efficacy of five notable ML algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Random Forest in predicting diabetes.
